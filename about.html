                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>The idea to develop this company first popped up when I went to buy a brand new home. I liked the space and the location it was in. However, I didn't like the design of the house which is 
                    a big thing. In order for someone to live happily in their house, they need to like it. Some people adjust with the design, while some people find houses that they like. This company
                    is for people who want to customize their home in a way they like.
